1. Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 

Ans:- 1.HTTP/2 can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection. 
        It allows you to download web files asynchronously from one server. Which is not possible in HTTP1.1
2. HTTP1.x used to process text commands to complete request-response cycles.
   HTTP2 will use binary commands (in 1s and 0s) to execute the same tasks. 
3. Web browsers support HTTP/2 via encrypted connections hence we get added
   security, which does not happen in HTTP/1.
4. In HTTP 1,The concept of headers both for requests (from the client machine) as well as responses (from servers) was introduced. 
   While HTTP2 uses header compression to reduce the overhead caused by TCP’s slow-start mechanism.
5. The concept of headers both for requests (from the client machine) as well as responses (from servers) was introduced.
   HTTP2 servers push likely-to-be-used resources into a browser’s cache, even before they’re requested.
   This allows browsers to display content without additional request cycles.
